    <p>I love Sprite. The refreshing lemon-lime flavor clashing with the spicy sparkle of soda makes for the best soda there is. Not only that, it is not filled with caramel color like most other sodas are. Because of this, it appears clear and looks healthier. It's probably not actually healthier, but I enjoy feeling like it is.</p>
